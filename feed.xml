                <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt; color: #676767;">Weber and Lang are a father and son duo who are obsessed with electroculture almost as much as I am. In this brief post, I’d like to share with you some of the amazing gains that these guys achieved by simply applying 5 Volts to a number of tomato plants grown in 5 gallon buckets…</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt;"><span style="color: #676767;">In preparation for science fair season. Lang and his dad got in touch with me to get advice on running some electro-horticulture experiments. They found that by growing tomato plants in a drought-resistant grow system called a </span><a href="http://www.globalbuckets.org/">sub-irrigation planter (SIP</a><span style="color: #676767;">) they didn’t have to worry about watering as much, since it became something they just needed to do every few days rather than daily.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt;"><span style="color: #676767;">These guys have done a great job with their experiments… Over 2-3 seasons they have consistently achieved yield gains of over 50% by weight.  This was accomplished using pulsed electroculture at a voltage of about 3.7 Volts.  Similar results can be seen by looking at how well my friend Bill did in his </span><a href="http://stage.electricfertilizer.com/electricfertilizer.com/2014/01/backyard-garden-electroculture-creates-large-broccoli-tomato-eggplants/">electrified home garden</a><span style="color: #676767;">. If you take a look at the pictures below, you’ll also see that the plants themselves tend to grow faster as well.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt;"> <img class="post__image" src="https://electrogrow.github.io/ef-blog-site/media/posts/3/weber-tomato-early-2014-800x367.jpg" alt="" width="799" height="367"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt;"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt; color: #676767;">As a result of their experiments, Lang has placed in the top-3 in two state science fair competitions.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt; color: #676767;">Nowadays, they’re looking into using clones to keep the genetic variability between samples as close as possible, allowing them to fine-tune the process.</p>

<p>The HarvestStorm Alpha-1 Grow Stimulator is a system designed to make trying out electroculture easy.  Electroculture is an experimental crop-enhancement technology that has been around for over 200 years.  While traditional systems involved the use of large copper plates or high-voltages, this device makes electroculture safe &amp; easy - plug and play!  Based on our research and the needs of plants, some experimentation may be needed.  The system supports 4 different built-in signaling protocols that include well-known frequency groups like Schumann resonance frequencies, Solfreggio frequencies, and others.  The unit is expandable enabling you to share the signal with many other plants or plant groups for protocol-specific efficacy testing or deploying at-scale.  The unit comes with a pair of food-safe electrodes and a UL-rated power supply.  Custom frequencies &amp; protocols are available on-request.</p>
